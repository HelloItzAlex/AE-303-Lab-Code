%% Description -- Please Read!
%
% This script imports the data from the .csv files for the PIV lab of
% AE303. A status is printed to the command window as each file is imported
% and then once again as each file's data is formatted. Each .csv file
% represents one instant in time for the flow. The data was recorded at 150
% Hz, so 300 files corresponds to 2 seconds of data. 
%
% This script checks if the data has been read before so that one does not
% spend extraneous time re-importing data. However, if the import portion
% of the script is terminated early, the parsing portion of the script will
% not function properly and the workspace should be cleared before running
% this script again. 
%
% To further avoid repeating portions of the script, divide the script
% into sections with the '%% Title' as is done already and take advantage
% of the 'Run Section' option to the right of 'Run' in Matlab.
%
% The purpose of this script is to allow the student to work with the data
% presented rather than put unnecessary time into writing their own import
% and formatting script since there is such a large amount of data.
%
%% Notes on the script output
%
% Upon this script's completion, there will exist 10 new variables in the
% workspace. Each is important for processing the PIV data. They are as
% follows:
%
%   data        This is the raw 3D array containing all of the data from
%               all 300 of the .csv files; dimensions 8806x11x300
%
%   N           The number of time steps in the dataset; 300
%
%   winsize     The 1x2 array with the number of rows and columns,
%               respectively, in the vector grid; should be [119,74]
%
%   X           The 2D matrix of the x-coordinates of the vector grid
%
%   Y           The 2D matris of the y-coordinates of the vector grid
%
%   u           The 2D matrix of the u-component of the velocity on the
%               vector grid with likely erroneous vectors replaced by NaN
%               with units of m/s
%
%   v           The 2D matrix of the v-component of the velocity on the
%               vector grid with likely erroneous vectors replaced by NaN
%               with units of m/s
%
%   u_raw       The 2D matrix of the u-component of the velocity on the
%               vector grid with no replaced vectors and units of m/s
%
%   v_raw       The 2D matrix of the v-component of the velocity on the
%               vector grid with no replaced vectors and units of m/s
%
%   u_pix       The 2D matrix of the u-component of the velocity on the
%               vector grid with likely erroneous vectors replaced by NaN
%               with units of pixel displacement
%
%   v_pix       The 2D matrix of the v-component of the velocity on the
%               vector grid with likely erroneous vectors replaced by NaN
%               with units of pixel displacement
%
% The velocity output arrays are all 3D arrays, where the first two
% dimensions represent the vector grid and the third dimension is how each
% time step is stored. Moving, for example, from u(:,:,1) to u(:,:,2) is 
% moving one time step forward in time, while referencing the full vector
% grid of u velocity components.
%
% The bottom of the parse portion of the script includes a commented out
% code which will plot and animation of the flow as the data is parsed.
% Running this portion can cause the code to take longer than desired to
% run, which is why it is commented out.
%
